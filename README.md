## Sub-array Sum division by K (Medium)

If an array is given, we need to find all contiguous sub arrays whose values when combined is divisible by K completely. 

### Brute force

For this take a count variable & a sum variable & run 2 loops where the second loop starts from the same index as that of first. Continue adding the value of that array to sum & if sum is divisible by k, increment count.

## Check for heights (Easy)

Create an expected array for heights of students stored in nums & find out the number when the expected height does not match the actual height. The expected height is in a non-decreasing order.

### Solution

Sort the array & store it in the expected array. Compare the values & increment count.
